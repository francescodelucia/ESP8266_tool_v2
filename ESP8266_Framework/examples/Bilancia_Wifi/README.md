# HX711-and-NodeMCU-ESP8266
An interface between the HX711 amplifier and NodeMCU ESP8266. Used to monitor the remaining content in a keg and then upload the measurement to Thingspeak.

Sparkfun has a great tutorial for how to interface the HX711. This can be found here: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/load-cell-amplifier-hx711-breakout-hookup-guide/

I've simply taken this a step further to demonstrate how to take a measurement from the HX711 and then upload this reading to an external endpoint (ie Thingspeak).
